# Pro Git Reedited Book Contents

This is the source code for the Pro Git Reedited book contents.  It is licensed under
the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 3.0 license. This is a heavily edited fork of Scott Chacon's Pro Git book, whose Git repository is located at

[https://github.com/progit/progit](http://).

It made no sense to keep the translations of Pro Git in this repository, so I removed them.

# Making Ebooks

Pro Git Reedited uses the same scheme for building readable versions of the book as Pro Git. For all information on how to do this, please see Scott's repository mentioned above.

# Errata

I welcome your feedback. Please send any comments to me at `nobozo@gmail.com`. To make sure I recognize them as comments about this book, please include [PGR] in the subject.
